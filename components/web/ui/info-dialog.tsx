            <p>Iâ€™ve always believed that open-source tools have the power to change how we work, create, and live. But too often, theyâ€™re scattered across the internet, hard to discover, and even harder to compare.</p>
            <p>
              I built this platform because I wanted to help people like meâ€”students, developers, researchers, and creatorsâ€”find the right tools without wasting hours searching. Itâ€™s not just about software, itâ€™s about empowering people to
              learn, build, and solve real problems faster.
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold">If even one person finds a tool here that makes their day easier, this project is worth it.</p>

            <p>
              This platform is an open-source catalog designed to make discovering tools easier. Every tool is organized by category and subcategory, complete with details like license, stack, and linksâ€”so you can find exactly what you
              need, faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether youâ€™re looking for a library, a framework, or an everyday utility, the goal is simple: <span className="italic">make open-source tools accessible, clear, and useful for daily life.</span>
            </p>

            <DialogTitle>Roadmap ðŸš§</DialogTitle>
            <p>This project is in active developmentâ€”hereâ€™s whatâ€™s coming soon:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
              <li>More frequent daily updates to the tool database</li>
              <li>Alternative tool recommendations for easier comparison</li>
              <li>Dedicated blog section for tutorials, stories, and updates</li>

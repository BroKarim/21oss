## 🌟 Why I Built This

I’ve always believed that open-source tools have the power to change how we work, create, and live. But too often, they’re scattered across the internet, hard to discover, and even harder to compare.

I built this platform because I wanted to help people like me—students, developers, researchers, and creators—find the right tools without wasting hours searching. It’s not just about software, it’s about empowering people to learn, build, and solve real problems faster.

**If even one person finds a tool here that makes their day easier, this project is worth it.**
